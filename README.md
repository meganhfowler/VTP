Make sure you have a csv file called `raw_scores.csv`
In `raw_scores.csv` you should have a column with all the team names, and the scores for each week in a column under the dates. If a team has no score for the week (they did not show up), do not enter any values.

To RUN:
`python3 adjust_scores.py`

This generates a csv file called `adjsuted_scores.csv` which contains the adjsuted scores for each week and the running total.
